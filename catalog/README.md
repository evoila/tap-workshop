# Catalog Entities

This directory contains YAML files for creating entities for the developer portal. The developer portal is provided by 
[Backstage](https://backstage.io) and is part of a TAP cluster with the purpose to provide an overview about running
applications, APIs, users, groups etc..
Those so-called _entities_ are managed through the _catalog_ within the developer portal.
In order to register an entity, in the developer portal, go to components and select _Create Component_. There, you
can provide a YAML-Entity from this repository.
Note, that the API-Entity contains the API-Definition for the application found under /Example-Java-Application/.
